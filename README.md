# css-images
Images made from pure CSS. It is truly the first time that I'm feeling quite excited to do this, and a 50 day challenge homg. But checklist first:

- [x] Template Engine (Gulp and Nunchucks/Handlebars)
- [ ] Learn Animations, Vue.js
- [ ] Create randomized wallpaper from htmls as chrome plugin (shelved for future)
- [ ] Gulp-rev for cache busting 
- [ ] Pokemon Theme

### Gulp
Since gulp allows for an automated workflow, all you gotta do is run:

- `gulp` which will execute the run and watch task (check `gulpfile.js`)
- `gulp new --name <name-of-file>` will create a new html in app/pages and scss file in app/scss.
